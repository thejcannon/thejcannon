ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @thejcannon (I'm also @joshua-cannon-techlabs, and [Dunder Seuss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSpzTx-S8B0))

Most of the time I'm contributing to [Pantsbuild](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants), but I'll contribute to any project, honestly.

I believe that in OSS, if you open a bug/feature request you ought to at least attempt to contribute the fix/feature.
